# Lung_Cancer_Analysis_and_Modal_Creation

This Project aims to analyze the surveyed lung cancer dataset and get insight from the dataset and visualize the same. It also aims Build an supervised learning model to predict the lung cancer using various python libraries and calculate the accuracy for the following.

The NoteBook Briefly Visualizes Dataset with Histograms , Barplots and Heatmaps to get a basic idea

Then Three basic classifications are implemented.
-> Naive Bayes Classifier
-> Random Forest Classifier
-> Decision Tree Clasifier

//additionally pickle is used to serialize and deserialize the python object structure for Random Forest.

Finally Accuracy rate and Classification Report has been printed for each model.
